<h1>Editor</h1>
<p><strong><u>Editing</u> is the process of selecting</strong> and preparing writing, photography, visual, audible, and film media used to convey information. The editing process can involve correction, condensation, organization, and many other modifications performed with an intention of producing a correct, consistent, accurate and complete work.
The editing process often begins with the author's idea for the work itself, continuing as a collaboration between the author and the editor as the work is created. Editing can involve creative skills, human relations and a precise set of methods.

<p style="margin-top:45px"><strong>Editors  work on producing an issue of Bild,</strong>  West Berlin, <u>1977.</u> Previous front  pages are affixed to the wall behind them.
There are various editorial positions in  publishing. Typically, one finds editorial  assistants reporting to the senior-level  editorial staff and directors who report to  senior executive editors. Senior executive  editors are responsible for developing a  product for its final release. The smaller  the publication, the more these roles overlap.
